# Array basics and fundamentals

a = [1,1,2,2,3,3,4]

b = [5,5,4,4,3,3,2]

# c = a | b  # merge these two arrays a and b and remove duplicate data and stores it to c

# c = b | a  # merge these two arrays b and a and remove duplicate data and stores it to c

# c = a & b  # compare common elements in the array a and array b and stores it to c

c = b & a  # compare common elements in the array b and array a and stores it to c

print c
